**the graphs in jammer pages doesn't show the accurate history of the jammer's
rank over time**

this is because jammers can remove/private their game, or add/remove
contributors to their game. this will modify the data on itch.io, and will then
affect the data that this unofficial leaderboard scrap. the old data of these
modified games will be lost and replaced with the new modified data. the past
will be changed
